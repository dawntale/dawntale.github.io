I love games. I know right? Who doesn't love games.

But do you know how to make a game? Well, that's what I do, **making games**. <sub>Yeah, I bold it out.</sub>

Awesome? Nope, it isn't awesome, it's my life.

I used Unity to kick my games. Why no Unreal? Well, Unity is (was) light and easy to work with, and the most important is the mighty C#.

I think thats enough of me. You can play around with that **rounded menu button on top right** of your screen or you wanna read my blog below. You will find something awesome in there.

**Has something in mind?** My contacts are on the bottom of my pic.
