## Hi, I'm **Fajar Setya Budi**
### a game developer
<br/>

We love games. I know right? Who doesn't love games. But do you know how to make a game? Well, that's what I do, **making games**. <sub>Yeah, I bold it out.</sub>

Awesome? Nope, it isn't awesome, it's my life.

I used Unity to jump-start my games. Why no Unreal? Well, Unity is (was) light and easy to work with, and the most important is the o-mighty C#, a programming language on steroid.

I you have interested in me , you may visit <a class="badge badge-primary px-3 py-1" href="/resume">MY RESUME</a> or <a class="badge badge-primary px-3 py-1" href="/portfolios">MY PORTFOLIO</a> pages. Or you can play around with that <span class="badge badge-primary px-3 py-1">rounded menu button on the top right corner of your screen </span>. You will find something awesome in there.

I think thats enough. <span class="badge badge-primary px-4 py-2">Has something in mind?</span> My contacts are on the bottom of my pic.
